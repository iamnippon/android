## Privacy Policy

This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how the Calculator App ("App", "we", "us" or "our") collects, protects, and uses the personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you ("User", "you" or "your") may provide in the App and on our service ("Service").

### Collection of Personal Information
We do not collect any personal information from the users of our App. The App does not require any form of registration, allowing you to use the App without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information.

### Use of Collected Information
Since we do not collect any personal information, we do not use your personal information in any way.

### Non-Personal Data Collection
Our App may collect non-personal information, such as device type, operating system version, and usage statistics, to help us improve the App's functionality and user experience. This data is aggregated and anonymized to ensure that it cannot be used to identify you personally.

### Children's Privacy
Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take necessary actions.

### Data Security
We value your trust in providing us with your non-personal information and are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### Third-Party Services
Our App may contain links to other sites or use third-party services that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link or use a third-party service, you will be directed to that third party's site or service. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites or services. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
